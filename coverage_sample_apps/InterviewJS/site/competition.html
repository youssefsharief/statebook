        <h1 class="text-center">Enter our competition</h1>
        <p class="blacktext">Are you a journalism, media studies, or communications student? Are you interested in new and interactive forms of storytelling? Are you keen to explore new ways of engaging audiences?</p>
        <p class="blacktext">We’d like to invite you to become an InterviewJS beta tester, to give us feedback to your experience, and to enter a story built with InterviewJS into our competition.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">What is InterviewJS?</h2>
        <p class="blacktext">Imagine you have just researched a feature story, covered a growing debate, or embarked on an investigation: You will have strong, long-form interviews in which your interviewees express different points of view, and you’re like to have multimedia elements for illustration.</p>
        <p class="blacktext">InterviewJS enables you to convert these interviews into multimedia-rich question and answer stories in a chat app format.</p><p class="blacktext">Start by introducing the story and the characters before reaching the chat dashboard where you can turn interview quotes into text messages and introduce interactivity by inserting questions and multimedia. </p>
        <p class="blacktext">The result are self contained InterviewJS, mobile first stories which are accessed via a url. Users are engaged not just by messaging with the interviewees but also through the use of videos, maps, audio, charts and any other type of embedded content. At the end, they receive feedback on how much of the story they have explored, and they are invited to have their say via a story-related opinion poll.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">The Prize:</h2>
        <p class="blacktext">A jury composed of Al Jazeera commissioning editors and digital producers drawn from our four news hubs in Doha, London, Washington and Kuala Lumpur will select a winner and two runner-ups.</p>
        <p class="blacktext">One lucky winner will receive a cash prize of 650 Euros. We will also select two runner-ups and all three stories will be published by Al Jazeera English on the InterviewJS website.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Judging criteria:</h2>
        <p class="blacktext">Our judges will reward:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The originality of the chosen story.</li>
        <li>The strength of the interviews conducted and used.</li>
        <li>Use of multimedia such as text, images, video, sound, maps and more.</li>
        <li>Demonstration of the full potential of InterviewJS as an interactive and engaging storytelling tool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="text-center">How to enter:</h2>
        <p class="blacktext">To qualify for the competition you must be enrolled at BA or MA level in a journalism, media studies, or communications degree. The winners will be required to submit proof of enrollment.</p> 
        <p class="blacktext">The rules of journalism apply to all stories submitted for competition: the reporting must be factual, balanced, fair, and accurate. Interviews can be sub-edited but meaning must not be altered and quotes must never be made up.</p>
        <p class="blacktext">As Al Jazeera seeks to publish the three finalists on a website, all winners must be able to provide us with consent from their interviewees.  Winners must be able to demonstrate the right to use any multimedia that’s been included.</p>
